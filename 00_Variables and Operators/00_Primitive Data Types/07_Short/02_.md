`short` functions similarly to `int` as it can only hold whole, non-decimal numbers. This datatype was commonly used when 16-bit computers were used, and are rarely used now as `int` has pretty much taken its place. However, `short` takes up about half the space of an `int`, so in a specific case when you are dealing with a large list of whole numbers, you may chose to use `short` to save space. With that being said, we will just use `int` for most of our programs.
