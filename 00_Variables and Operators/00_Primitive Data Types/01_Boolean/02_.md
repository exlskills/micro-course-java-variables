We see in the code above that boolean values don't necessarily have to come out "true". For example "7>9" will be false, while "7<9" will be true. Boolean is extremely useful because it allows particular statements and methods to be executed only in certain situations based on whether the boolean statement is true or false. For this reason, it is one of the most important primitive data types.

Later on, we will examine comparing boolean values to each other and the role that plays with control flow statements.
