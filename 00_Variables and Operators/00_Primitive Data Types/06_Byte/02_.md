The byte datatype takes up about four times less space than an `int`, but is not used for calculations and other methods. The byte datatype is useful when dealing with raw binary data for compatibility reasons. Similarly to `float`, `int` and the other integer related data types, the default value for `byte` is 0. The byte datatype can only hold whole, non-decimal numbers.
