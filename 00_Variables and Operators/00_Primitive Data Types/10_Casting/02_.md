We just converted the `double` value 15.23 into an integer, which left only the whole number and the decimal places to be cut off. There is no rounding, it just ignores the numbers after the decimal point during casting. When you convert an `int` to a `double`, a decimal point will be added to match with the structure of a `double`. For example, `double varOne = (double) 15;` assigns 15.0 to `varOne`.

Even though it is possible to convert an `int` to a `double` without casting, it is best practice to always use casting for precision and thorough logic. Also, be careful with the loss of precision when converting data types. i.e. losing decimal points is losing precision.
