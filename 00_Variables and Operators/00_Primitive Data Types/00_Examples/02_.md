The eight primitive data types, `byte`, `short`, `int`, `float`, `double`, `char` and `boolean` will be covered more in depth later. Let's start by exploring what a data type is. Data types enable us to tell the program what kind of data we are trying to represent and use. Always keep in mind that data type names are extremely case sensitive. "Int" is not the same as "int". The primitive, or fundamental, data types can function as building blocks. There are also larger, non-primitive data types that are made up of smaller components. We will dive into data types by learning the eight primitive data types first.
