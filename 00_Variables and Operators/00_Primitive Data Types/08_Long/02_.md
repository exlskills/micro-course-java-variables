This example takes us through parsing a `long` variable from a `String` because the value is too big to write in the program. We will look more closely at this functionality in later sections. Similarly to what we have seen before with declaration of primitive data types, the addition of an 'l' or 'L' at the end of the line informs the program that the value is a `long`.

Although `long` holds twice the memory of `int`, it is an extremely useful data type when working with astronomically large whole integers such as the weight of the earth or the speed of light and sound. Similar to `int`, `long` will always be a whole, non-decimal number.
