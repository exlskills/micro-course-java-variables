As with floats, doubles may have the character 'd' or 'D' at the end of the number to tell the program that the number is a `double`. Similar to a `float` datatype, the default value for `double` is "0.0". Doubles have one of the largest ranges of numbers compared to the other primitive data types.

Although a `double` is more accurate than `float`, it is still not recommended for currency as it is not precise enough to calculate strict numbers of this kind.
