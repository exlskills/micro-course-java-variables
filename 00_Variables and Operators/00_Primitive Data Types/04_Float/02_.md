`float` variables can be represented with a lowercase 'f' OR uppercase 'F' at the end, which asks the program specifically for a single-precision float literal which deals with a 32 bit floating point. Even without the 'f' or 'F' at the end the program, it assumes a `float` is declared and initialized.

This datatype is used when dealing with decimals. As said in the comments of the code above, `float` can take on a range of values. However, `double` is preferred when we want a more precise answer as `double` deals with 64 bit numbers. The `float` primitive data type is NOT used for precise values like currency because the data type is sometimes approximate and rounded.
