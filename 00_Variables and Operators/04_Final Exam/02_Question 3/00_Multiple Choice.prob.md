What is printed as a result of executing this statement? <<

( ) 4 {{Incorrect because 401 will be printed. View the step-by-step solution below.}}
( ) 5 {{Incorrect because 401 will be printed. View the step-by-step solution below.}}
( ) 41 {{Incorrect because 401 will be printed. View the step-by-step solution below.}}
(x) 401 {{Correct because 401 will be printed after the expression is evaluated through standard order of operations.
<p>The process is shown below:</p>
404 / 10 * 10 + 1<br/>
= 40 * 10 + 1  (results in 40 because the division occurs between two integers.)<br/>
= 400 + 1<br/>
= 401}}
