>>Consider the following code segment:

```
double varOne;
int varTwo = 56;
int varThree = 25;
varOne = varTwo / varThree;
System.out.println(varOne);
```

What is printed as a result of executing this code segment?<<

( ) 2 {{Incorrect because <code>result</code> is a <code>double</code> value, so it should have a decimal.}}
(x) 2.0 {{Correct because <code>varTwo</code> and <code>varThree</code> are both integers, so Java will perform integer division and then assign the value to <code>varOne</code>, a <code>double</code> value.}}
( ) 2.2{{Incorrect because the decimal is truncated when the integer division is performed.}}
( ) 2.24{{Incorrect because the decimal is truncated when the integer division is performed.}}
( ) An error will occur.{{Incorrect because no precision is lost when converting from an <code>int</code> value to a <code>double</code> value. However, if it was a double division assigned to an integer, an error would occur because precision is lost.}}

||What happens when you divide two integers that donâ€™t divide perfectly? ||
