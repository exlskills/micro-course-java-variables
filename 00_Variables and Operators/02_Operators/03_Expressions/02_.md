Expressions can be written without using any spaces at all, but the use of one or more spaces to visually separate the parts without changing the meaning is useful for the programmer and reader.

Keep in mind the discussion we had previously on division of integers. If the operands are integers, these operators will perform integer arithmetic. If one or both operands are floating points, the operators will perform floating point arithmetic. Any number with a decimal would result in a `double` or `float`. For integers, 5/2 results in 2. For floating point, 5.0/2.0 results in 2.5 and 5/2.0 results in 2.5.
