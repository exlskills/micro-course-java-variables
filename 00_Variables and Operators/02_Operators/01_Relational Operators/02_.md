All of the operators above return a true or false result. The first four operators are recognizable and common. They work the same way as you learned in math class. Check the text below for an explanation of the operators functions.

1. \> Tests whether the first integer is greater than the second integer.
2. < Tests whether the first integer is smaller than the second integer.
3. \>= Tests whether the first integer is greater than or equal to the second integer.
4. <= Tests whether the first integer is less than or equal to the second integer.
5. == Tests whether the first integer is equal to the second integer. <br>

Remember that '=' cannot be used to compare two values because a solo '=' is used only for assigning values to variables as we saw in our previous courses.
6. != Tests whether the first integer is different from the second integer. <br>

Therefore, a statement like `5 != 7` will return a result of "true".
