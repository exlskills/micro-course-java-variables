Something to keep in mind when assigning values is that the calculation on the right side of the equal sign is completed before assigning the variable on the left with its new value. As we see in the code above, `exampleVariableOne` and `exampleVariableTwo` are added before being assigned to the new value of variable `exampleVariableOne`. This makes the new value for `exampleVariableOne` 60\.

The "+=" and the "-=" functions add or subtract integers together before assigning them to the variable. Therefore, `exampleVariableTwo += 5;` is actually the same as the statement `exampleVariableTwo = exampleVariableTwo + 5;`. `exampleVariableTwo` increases by a value of 3 as a result of the program because it adds 5 and subtracts 2 before printing.

Keep in mind that it is possible to also use "\*=", "/=", or "%=" if you are comfortable with using these "shortcut" operators.
