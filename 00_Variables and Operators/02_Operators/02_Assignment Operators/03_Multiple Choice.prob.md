>>What is the new value of <code>varOne</code> after the following code is executed?

```
int varOne = 12;
varOne += 5;
varOne -= 10;
varOne = 12;
```

(x) 12 {{Correct because <code>varOne</code> would equal 12 after the statements are executed. 
<p>The process is shown below. Use the comments to guide you through each step:</p>
Line 1: <code>varOne</code> = 12 because it is initialized with the integer 12.<br/>
Line 2: <code>varOne</code> = 17 because the statement <code>varOne += 5</code> adds 5 to <code>varOne</code>.
Line 3: <code>varOne</code> = 7 because the statement <code>varOne -= 10</code> subtracts 10 from <code>varOne</code>.<br/>
Line 4: <code>varOne</code> = 12 because the statement <code>varOne = 12</code> sets <code>varOne</code> back to 12.}}
