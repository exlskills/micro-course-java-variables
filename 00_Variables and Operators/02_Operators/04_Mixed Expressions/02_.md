Do either of the results surprise you? Take a look at the details. Remember, if any of the operands are a floating point, the whole arithmetic operation becomes floating point. Also, parenthesis have the highest precedence in the order of operations and must be evaluated first. Let's rearrange the mixed expressions to the correct order of evaluation:

(1/3+7.5) / 2.5 = (0+7.5) / 2.5 = (7.5) / 2.5 = 3.0 <br>

(`exampleVariableOne` is a `double`, so the result is 3.0, not 3)

(7/4 + 2/6) + 4 = (1 + 0) + 4 = 5
