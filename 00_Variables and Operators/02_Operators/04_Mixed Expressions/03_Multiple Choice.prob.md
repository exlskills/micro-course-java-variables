>>What will the value of <code>varOne</code> be after the following expression is evaluated?<br/>
<code>double varOne = 8+7x4-2.0/4 + (5-3x4-2);</code> <<

(x) 26.5 {{Correct because the order of operation is followed with consideration to integer/float point division.
<p>The process is shown below:</p>
8+7x4-2.0/4 + (5-3x4-2)<br/>
= 8+7x4-2.0/4 + (5-12-2)<br/>
= 8+7x4-2.0/4 + (-9)<br/>
= 8+28-2.0/4 + (-9)<br/>
= 8+28-0.5 + (-9)<br/>
= 35.5 + (-9)<br/>
= 26.5}}
