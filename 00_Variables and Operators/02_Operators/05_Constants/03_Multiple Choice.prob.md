>>Which of the following is a valid identifier for a constant variable?<<

( ) <pre><code>public final int constantVar = 10;</code></pre> {{Incorrect because this is the standard way to declare other variables.}}
( ) <pre><code>public final int CONSTANTVAR = 30;</code></pre> {{Incorrect because it is lacking an underscore.}}
( ) <pre><code>public final boolean constantvar = true;</code></pre> {{Incorrect because the characters are not capitalized and separated with an underscore.}}
(x) <pre><code>double final CONSTANT_VAR = 2.3213;</code></pre> {{Correct because identifiers for constant variables have to be in upper case with words separated with underscore.}}
( ) <pre><code>public final char Constantvar = 'r';</code></pre> {{Incorrect because "var" is not capitalized and separated from "Constant" with an underscore.}}
