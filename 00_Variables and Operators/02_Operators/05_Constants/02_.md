Since constants cannot be changed, a syntax error or a compile-time error will be thrown if a change is attempted to a variable with the reserved word `final`.

One advantage of using constants instead of numbers is that the source code would be easier to read and check for debugging. In addition, if a constant needs to change, the change only has to be made in one place, where it is initialized. The programmer does not have to look for every occurrence of the variable and change each one individually. Constants are a great way to keep track of variables you don't want to change in any way while running your code.
