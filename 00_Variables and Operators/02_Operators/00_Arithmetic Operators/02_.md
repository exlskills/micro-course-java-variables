Just as we learned in math class, Java honors the order in which mathematical operations should be performed. Division, multiplication, modulus (%), followed by any addition and subtraction. A minor difference between math principles and Java is if we are dividing two integers, the Java answer will also be an integer, not a number with a decimal point, following the same rule of truncation we discussed earlier. Let's look at an example: the Java result for 15/2 will be 7, not 7.5.

One new operator to you may be the modulus operator, whose function returns the remainder of dividing the first number by the second number.
