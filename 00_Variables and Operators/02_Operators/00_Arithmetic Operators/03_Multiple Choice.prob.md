>>Given the fact that variable flightTime is larger that 60, which of the following can be used to replace <code>/* missing code */</code> so that the flightTime can be displayed in hours and minutes?

-( )

+(x)

<pre><code>hours = hours + flightTime / 60;

{{Correct because <code>hours = hours + flightTime / 60</code> accurately returns the number of hours by truncating the decimal and <code>minutes = flightTime%60</code> accurately returns the number of minutes by taking the remainder of the division.}}

-(x)

+( )

<pre><code>hours = hours + flightTime % 60;
minutes = flightTime / 60; 
</code></pre> 

{{Incorrect because the wrong arithmetic operators are used when calculating <code>hours</code> and <code>minutes</code>.}}

-( )

+( )

<pre><code>minutes = flightTime + flightTime % 60;</code></pre> 

{{Incorrect because the <code>hours</code> variable is not touched and remains at 0. Also, <code>minutes</code> will become a larger value than <code>flightTime</code>, which does not make sense.}}

-( )

+( )

<pre><code>hours = flightTime / 60;</code></pre> 

{{Incorrect because the <code>minutes</code> variable is not touched and remains at 0.}}

||Mathematically, how can you get the number of hours from a number that only represents minutes? ||
