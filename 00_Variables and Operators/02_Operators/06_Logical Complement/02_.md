The value of the two boolean variables are different because one is the inverse of the other. The NOT operator changes the value of `exampleVariableOne` from true to false and assigns false to `exampleVariableTwo`.

Please remember to use brackets to section off the NOT operator so it works as intended. As we keep working in Java, especially with if statements, we will see uses for this operator surface as an alternative for writing long lines of code.
