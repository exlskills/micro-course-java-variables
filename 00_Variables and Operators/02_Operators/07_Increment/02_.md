There are two ways to use the increment operator; prefix and postfix increment. The prefix increment looks like `++variablename;` while the postfix increment looks like `variablename++;`. Both of these operations add one to the value in the variable. The difference between the two is the order of how it works. If we use the "++" operator as a prefix like `++varOne;`, the value of `varOne` is incremented by one before the value of `varOne` is returned. If we use ++ operator as postfix like `varOne++;`, the original value of `varOne` is returned before `varOne` is incremented by one. This means that the original value of `varOne` is printed while the value increases by one after the print statement. It is essential to know the difference between the two types of incrementing even though we usually don't print these values. Incrementing is used heavily in loops, a topic we will examine later in the course.
