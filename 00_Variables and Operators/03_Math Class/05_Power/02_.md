The function of the `Math.pow()` method mirror the function of exponents we learned in math class. For example, if the second input is zero, the result will always be "1.0" because any number raised to the power of zero is one. Also, if the second input is "1.0", the result with be the first input. If the power function has expressions that use division or any other operation, the expression is evaluated before the power method is run. Because of the previous statement, fractions are not a recommended method for writing your expression. Please be careful of using numbers such as "1/2" because this would result in "0.0", not "0.5".
