This method will return a `double` number even if the result is a perfect square. The error that will occur if we use a number less than zero is a result of "NaN", which stands for "Not a Number". Therefore, if we were to write `Math.sqrt(-4)`, the return will be "NaN". Imaginary numbers cannot be represented or returned using this method. And lastly, keep in mind that this function will only return one positive square root value.
