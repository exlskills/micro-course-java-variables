The absolute value method works the same way as it does in a regular algebra class. The input for this method could be an `int`, `float`, `double` or a `byte` value and will return the same data type as the input. Keep in mind that none of the outputs are rounded when producing the result of the method. Inputting a positive value would simply return the same value while inputting a negative value would return the negative value without the minus sign.
