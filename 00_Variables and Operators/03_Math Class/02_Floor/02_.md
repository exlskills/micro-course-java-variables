As the nearest whole number that is less than or equal to 10.4 is 10, 10.0 is printed. Similarly, since the closest whole number that is less than or equal to -20.4 is -21, -21.0 is printed. Notice that even if we input a non-decimal number into the floor function, a `double` is returned. Since data precision is not hindered when you convert from an `int` data type to a `double`, Java will do it without throwing any errors. The floor function's primary use is rounding, all ready for you to use while coding.
