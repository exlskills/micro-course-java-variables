We will go into further detail about the methods of the `Math` class later on, so let's explore `Math.PI`, one of the two fields of the `Math` class. This field represents the value of pi. A dot is used after typing "Math" to access the field and the method inside the `Math` class. You have to check the input and output type of the methods inside the `Math` class to use them correctly without throwing errors. To avoid syntax errors, the method and field names have to match the names written in the Java documentation for the `Math` class. You do not have to import the `Math` class as it is already part of the `java.lang` package.
