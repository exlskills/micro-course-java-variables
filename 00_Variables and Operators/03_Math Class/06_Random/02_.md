In order to increase our range from 0.0 to 100.0, we have to multiply the whole expression by 101 since the function's range is only 0.0 to 1.0. We then use casting to change the `double` to an `int` datatype value, which in turn truncates the decimal and gives us a whole number. There are different methods within the `Random` class which may be useful to you for various projects in the future.
