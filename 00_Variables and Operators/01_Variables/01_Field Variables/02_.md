Field variables, as opposed to local variables, can be called in any of the methods that exist in the same class. A field variable is available as long as the instance it belongs to is active. The class is active when any method in it is used. Therefore if the field variable belongs to the class, it can be used within any of the methods inside that class.

There are two categories of field variables: instance variables and class variables. The code we reviewed above shows examples of two class variables. We see this because they are declared with the `static` modifier. We will discuss the significance of `static` as we move further along in our courses.

Instance variables are non-static fields and therefore declared without the Java reserved word `static`. All of these values are unique to each instance of a class. This will be explained further when we study the concept of objects.
