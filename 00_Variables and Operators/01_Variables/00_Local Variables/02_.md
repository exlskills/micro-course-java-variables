In the example, we cannot print `exampleVariableThree` inside the main method because it exists only as a local variable in the `add()` method. This is where we revisit the concept of access control. The local variable is only active and returns within the method in which it was declared. A local variable is not visible to any other method besides the one in which it exists. If you have a variable that will be used in multiple classes, you must make sure it is outside the method. If you are referencing a local variable outside of the method it exists in, you will get a compile-time error due to access control and visibility.

In cases where you will only use a variable in one method, keep it local by keeping it inside the method so that no other methods or classes can see or make any changes to it and alter your desired outcome.

Keep in mind that the parameters in a method are examples of and function as local variables.
